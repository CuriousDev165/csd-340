                <p>Overwatch is pretty much my only hobby outside of software development. I'm a simple person with no other real interests. My free time is usually spent on Overwatch because it is a sufficiently mentally stimulating game that passes the time in a (usually) relaxing way.</p>

                <h3>C# Development</h3>

                <p>I've quickly grown accustomed to the way that C# works and how to develop using it as the primary language for a project. I have been exposed to Python and Java as well, but I prefer static typing over Python's inherent dynamic typing, and I personally dislike Java.</p>

            <h2>Experience</h2>
            <div class="column">
                <p>My personal experience includes a little under 2 years of personal practice with C# using a project targeted for production. Since I am not in a position to take on an internship, I have decided to use a real-world project to demonstrate my abilities. I am building a project with Visual Studio for Mac using .NET Core. The project consists of a Web API; MAUI cross-platform app; Contracts Class Library; Unit Test project; and Integration Test project. The project utilizes a MySQL Docker image for a development database; Serilog for event logging; and Seq as a dashboard for filtering and viewing those event logs. The project is version-controlled using Git and GitHub. The project uses token-based authentication with Json Web Tokens. The project is being developed using the Test-Driven Development framework in a Waterfall-style process (since the project is small enough that Agile isn't needed).</p>
